Employee Attrition Data Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition data to understand factors influencing employee retention and departure from the company. 
Various aspects of employee demographics, job characteristics, and satisfaction levels were examined to identify patterns and correlations associated with attrition.

Key Findings

Demographic Insights:
Single employees tend to leave the company more frequently compared to married or divorced individuals.

Job Related Factors:
Employees in certain job roles, such as Sales Representatives, are more likely to leave.
Job level and involvement are inversely correlated with attrition, with less experienced and less involved employees more likely to leave.

Personal Factors:
Age plays a significant role; younger employees are more prone to attrition.
Gender does not show a significant correlation with attrition rate based on the data analyzed.

Satisfaction and Engagement:
Employees who stayed tend to have higher satisfaction levels regarding job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and stock option level.
Proximity to home (DistanceFromHome) is higher for employees who stayed.

Financial and Work Related Aspects:
Monthly income is correlated with job level and total working hours.
Job level strongly influences total working hours.

Statistical Analysis
Correlations:
Age is strongly correlated with monthly income.
Monthly income is strongly correlated with job level and total working hours.

KDE (Kernel Density Estimate):
KDE plots were used to visualize the probability density of continuous variables such as age, daily rate, and monthly income.
Machine Learning Models Explored

Logistic Regression:
Trained and evaluated a logistic regression classifier to predict employee attrition based on the identified factors.

Random Forest Classifier:
Utilized a random forest classifier to further analyze and predict employee attrition, leveraging its ensemble learning capabilities.
Deep Learning Model:

Explored a deep learning model (specifically, an artificial neural network) to understand its effectiveness in predicting attrition, considering the complexity of interactions among variables.
Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to employee attrition within the company.
By understanding these factors, HR policies and practices can be adjusted to improve employee retention and satisfaction, ultimately benefiting organizational stability and performance.
